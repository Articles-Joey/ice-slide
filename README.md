# Death Race

Four player capture the flag game. Each player gets three bugs to start, if you lose all your bugs and you are eliminated. You can cross into other frogs zones to take their bugs but if they touch you while in their zone they send you back to your zone and stun you for a short period. Random powerups spawn at certain times that can change certain aspects of the game.

## Getting Started

```bash

## Multiplayer

Aiming to have multiplayer via P2P and Websockets. Websocket backend code is not in this repo or available at this time. P2P code will be included here.
